# PersonalTaskTracker

This web application I developed serves as a task tracker designed to make the monitoring of errands and to-do items easier. My motivation behind this project was to create a tool that would assist myself and others in staying organized and top of all tasks and responsibilities. It is very easy to become overwhelmed and forgotful when it comes to managing these responsibilities, so I thought creating a task tracking web application would be an effective solution.

# Usage

- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Mark tasks as complete.
- Delete tasks from the list.
